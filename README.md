# SQL Business Analytics on E-Commerce Database

The following report takes a mock, custom-built e-commerce database and uses SQL queries to extract data and insights valuable for a potential e-commerce business, such as website and traffic performance, product-level sales performance, and how customers access and interact with the website. Based on the results of the queries, I conducted analysis to help the business understand various user-interaction trends with the website, as well as to make bidding recommendations for the growth and profitability of the mock business.

This analysis was based and built on the course 'Advanced SQL: MySQL Data Analysis & Business Intelligence' by Maven Analytics. The database used in this project was created by John Pauler of Maven Analytics. 

Using `ipython-sql` package to connect MySQL server to Jupyter Notebook and make SQL queries.
